    <!-- Simply putting script files here to solve problem discussed below would not solve 
    as browser will try to download js files and as soon as it downloads js files, it would start
    parsing it causing error to come as html elements haven't been parsed yet -->
    <!-- <script src="assets/scripts/vendor.js"></script> -->
    <!-- <script src="assets/scripts/app.js"></script> -->

    <!-- To solve this, we need the browser to somehow download the script files when it encounters them
    but continues parsing the html file and only after parsing the complete html file it starts
    parsing the script files.
    This can be done by adding defer attribute keyword in the script.
    This saves time as browser downloads the script file as soon as it encounters it
    but also doesn't stop parsing the html page and only after parsing html completely, it starts parsing js files.
    Defer also preserves order of scripts -->
    <script src="assets/scripts/vendor.js" defer></script>
    <script src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer></script>

    <!-- Another keyword we can use is async, this causes the js files to be downloaded and as soon as they 
    are downloaded, they will be executed irrespective of whether html file is completely parsed or not.
    Also, with async, execution is done as soon as files are parsed without any order being preserved
    This means that if app.js was downloaded before vendor.js below, app.js would be executed before vendor.js -->
    <!-- <script src="assets/scripts/vendor.js" async></script> -->
    <!-- <script src="assets/scripts/app.js" async></script> -->

    <!-- The import of javascript files (below lines) is correct but has a great flaw -->
    <!-- The browser first downloads the html file, starts parsing it  -->
    <!-- Since, the js files are at the end of js file, at the end of parsing the js file,  -->
    <!-- browser downloads the script files. And after downloading, it parses them. -->
    <!-- Even though it is correct, it is time wasting as browser waits till it completely -->
    <!-- parses html before it even starts downloading js files. -->
    <!-- One way to reduce this time wastage is to put the script file at the top of html head section -->
    <!-- <script src="assets/scripts/vendor.js"></script>   // Commented them to move them up at head section-->
